The objective of Crossy Road is to cross an endless highway or series of roads and avoid obstacles as far as possible without dying. The player plays as a chosen character and must tap to go forward or swipe the screen in the appropriate direction to move the character horizontally.

I added a little twist to my version. It's crossy road, but slower. And reduxed! Making the game more challenging then ever before. But i didn't have anytime to add a scoreboard, sorry about that! And there's no other characters. I hope this game could be useful to you. Well that's it for me. Thank you for reading!
